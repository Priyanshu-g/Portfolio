      <span class="underlined lead">The story</span><br>
      <p class="lead">This was at first a personal project to see what I can do with jQuery and javascript. The new
        skills we were learning in Comp Eng related heavily to math so it was possible to make calculators for these new
        topics, all while learning jQuery. That's what this site first was, just something to make calculators on. Then
        we started learning more technology related to math in tech design. I also wanted to add more to the site so
        when the cheat sheet assignment was introduced to include all topics covered in one document, this website was a
        perfect choice. That's how this website went from a small project to a class assignment.</p><br><br>
      Hello! This is me 2 years older. I am updating the portfolio a bit and thought I should come back and add a bit to
      this assignment. We never ended up handing in the cheat sheet but I kept the cheat sheet website. To this day I go
      back and add new topics in math and engineering to help myself out in the future. Nowadays the website is not an
      assignment it is a personal project that helps me and my classmates to simple yet annoying calculations.

      <h1 class="display-4">The ESP8266 Weather Station</h1>
      <p class="lead"><span class="underlined lead">What was this project?</span><br>
        This project was an independent study unit for computer engineering. Try to build anything with anything in your
        budget. I chose to make a weather station with an ESP8266. The ESP8266 is a wifi module that works with
        Arduinos.
        <br><span class="underlined lead">The Story</span><br>
        The story of the ESP8266 Weather Station begins with a distance sensor. Initially, the distance sensor was to
        detect the height of the water and keep track of the water level in an area over some time. Although this seemed
        doable when the sensor was taken home, sound travelling through water at a different speed wasn't realized until
        it was too late, and due to covid, the sensor couldn't be swapped out. Resulting in the first project change, to
        make a temperature sensor that you can place outside and check the weather outdoors from a device indoors.

              After the project change there was a lot of issue yet to come. (skip to Dec
              15th)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
              The first was hosting the website that should be reachable by all devices in the same network. This went
              on for a really long time (skip to Jan
              9th)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
              The solution was simple. Rather then having the raspberry pi collect the data, transfer is to the esp, and
              then finally show the data off the esp site, I could just connet the esp to the sensor, collect the data
              from there and host the data immediatly, skipping need for any raspberry pi! The next and final major
              issue was using google charts to display the stored data well (skip to Jan,
              20th)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
              This problem was not too big. It only gave me an issue and took so long because I was new to it. Learning
              new things is always fun, so I was at least motivated to go through with it.

      <p class="lead"><span class="underlined lead">What was this project?</span><br><br>
        This project was a personal project that I started on my own. A long time hobby of mine is playing games so I
        thought it was about time I make one of my own. Since this is a personal project I did not document the making
        of the game. However, after finishing the first version of the game and loving the product I decided to add it
        to this portfolio.

      <p class="lead"><span class="underlined lead">So whats happening?</span><br><br>
        The video above shows the combat section of the game. It starts on the players turn. The player selected two
        orbs to swap. Any connection of 3 or more is broken and 2 points are added to the respective element per orb
        broken. After the points are added the orbs attacks, if they hit shields then the shields take damage, else the
        enemy player will take damage.
        <br>
        <br>
        After the player turn the computer gets a turn. This is an algorithm that looks at the board and finds possible
        swaps that allow for good attacks. The computer does the same action as the player and the game proceeds.
