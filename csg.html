            2. For quesiton 2, once again using the graph, we can see that the graph approaches 1 when x = 2.<br>Therefore, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 is <b>1</b><br>

        <h4 id="Derivative1">What is a derivative?</h4>
        <div class="lead block container">
          A derivative of a function is also a function, yet this function's values represent the original function's slope values at any x value<br>
          The derivative of f(x) is denoted as f'(x)<br><u><b>
          There are two ways to find f'(x) using f(x)</u><br>
          1. First Principles<br>
          2. Rules of differentiation</b>
        </div><br>
        <h4 id='First-Principles1'>First Principles</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          <img src="Derivatives/DerivativesPrinciapalsMethod.jpg"><br>
          Here is the First Principles method of finding the derivative of a function.<br>
          You would replace f(x+h) with f(x) but all 'x' variables are replaced with (x+h). Then you would replace f(x) with the original function.<br>
          From here you would simplify until the 'h' variable is out of the denominator.<br>
          The reason 'h' needs to be removed is because 'h' will be replaced with 0.<br>
          Once 'h' is 0 you can remove the limit and simplify, after which you will have found the derivative.<br><br>
          Let us do an example<br>

        <h4 id='Rules-Of-Differentiation1'>Rules Of Differentiation</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          When given f(x) there are a set of rules you can follow that allow you to find f'(x). Let us take a look at them<br>

        <h4 id='Purpose1'>What is the purpose or applications of derivatives?</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          Remember that the derivative function represents the rate of change at any point of the main function.<br>
          The most common application of derivatives is position, velocity, and acceleration graphs.<br>
          The velocity function is the derivative of the position function and the acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function.<br>
          This also means that the acceleration function is the second derivative of the position graph (this just means the derivative of the derivative and is denoted as f''(x)).

          <img  class="large-img" src="Derivatives/ApplicationsOfDerivativesExample.jpg"><br>
          This can be duplicated and done the same for height graphs. The only difference is that when v(t)=0 the s(t) is at a maximum.

        <div class="lead block">
          There is one more application of derivatives, WORD PROBLEMS (more specifcally optimization problems)! <br>
          For word problems we have an algorithm. Lets go over it<br><b><u>Algorithm for Solving Optimization Problems</u></b><p class="text-left">1. Understand the problem. Identify quantities that can vary. Draw a labeled diagram, if possible, and state the given and required quantities.<br>2. Determine a function that represents the quantity to be optimized. Then, using the given information, write this quantity in terms of one independent variable.<br>3. Determine the domain of the function to be optimized, using information given in the problem. The domain must be written in terms of the independent variable used in step 2.<br>4. Use the algorithm for extreme values to find the absolute maximum or minimum value of the function on the domain found in step 3.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Algorithm for Determining the Extreme (Absolute) Values of a Function on a closed interval [a,b]</u><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a function f(x) has a derivative at each point on the closed interval a&lt;x&lt;b, calculate f(x) at:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All point where f'(x)=0 and end points on the domain<br>5. Use the results in step 4 to answer the original problem. Check your answer for validity. Does it make sense? Indicate correct units.</p>
          <br>Let us do an example.<br><br>A chain of stores has been selling a line of socks for $7 each and has been averaging sales of 12000 socks sold a month. They decide to increase the price, but their market research indicates that for each $1 increase in price, sales will fall by 500. Find the price that will maximize their revenue.<br><br>Step 1 - Understand the problem and what variable can change<br>We know that the price of socks is the changing variable and the number sold is the affected factor. If the price and number sold is changing, then so is the revenue (the amount we want to maximize)<br>Step 2 - Determine a function that represents the quantity to be optimized in one variable<br><img src="Derivatives/NonMajorStep2.jpg"><br>Step 3 - Determine a domain<br><img src="Derivatives/NonMajorStep3.jpg"><br>Step 4 - Use the algorithm to find the max<br><img src="Derivatives/NonMajorStep4.jpg"><br>Step 5 - Check how right this seems and finialize<br>7+8.5 = $15.5. Therefore, the cost which would yield the max revenue is $15.5 per sock. Based on the parameters given, this makes sense.</div><br><br>

Earth's iron deposits have been depleted. You are a company on an offworld venture in mars. The costs in the first part were actually the cost for different thicknesses of iron ($1/m<sup>2</sup> for thin wall and $2/m<sup>2</sup> for thick base). Now the question. A new iron deposit has been found and the price of iron has crashed. The new prices for iron are $0.01/m<sup>2</sup> for thin walls and $0.02/m<sup>2</sup> for thick base (very big deposit). After the next shipment your company will be bought off for your worth. The next shipment is a 1000 of the pots you have been making. In order to get access to the new prices of extraction you need to build a miner for $1k. The new iron however has an issue with octagonal shapes, it can only form the shape at your required thickness when the length of the side is under 5m. Do you stay with the original prices or do you pay the $1k for the new prices? What is the total cost?

If we adjust the domain of 'a' to being between 0 and 5 instead of 0 and 20, we see a major change. Our derivative's intercept is not in the domain anymore. Yet if we look at the extrema values in our previous equation (this can be done with the new one but is not needed) we see that from 0 to 6.554 the cost is decreasing, after which the value keeps going up. Meaning our lowest cost will be our largest available 'a' value, 5.<br>Finally, we calulate the cost for each situation (remember to add 1000) and then compare the two costs<br><img src="Derivatives/FinalCosts.jpg"><br>Therefore, buying the new deposit of iron is the right choice and it will cost $14,290<br><br><b>You look to your boss in disbelief as your numbers show a scary difference is overall costs.

        <h4 id="Algorithm1">How do you accurately sketch a curve?</h4>
        <div class="lead block">To accurately sketch a curve we can use the <b><u>Algorithm For Graph Sketching</u></b><br>
        <img src="Sketching/GraphSketching.jpg"><br>We will go over each step and an example on how to do them. Then we will do a final complete sketch of a graph

        <h4 id="Step-11">Step 1</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          The first step is fairly simple. Certain situations in math result in "undefined". Most of the time these situations can be identified. You must note down the x values that result in undefined. The most common situations are, the denominator cannot be 0 and you cannot square root a negative number! If you look at the examples in the algorithm we can solve for when the denominator is 0 and find 1 and -3 are out of the domain. For the second example when anything is to the power of (1/2) you are square rooting the number. The brackets result in a negative number when x is smaller than 1. Therefore the domain would be x>1.
        </div>
        <h4 id="Step-21">Step 2</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          This step includes the phrase "(if easily determined)." This means it would only take a few steps to find the intercept. For example, using quadratic formula or factoring to find the x-intercepts, maybe even equating the function to 0 to find the x-intercepts. To find the y-intercepts just substitute the x's for 0.
        </div>
        <h4 id="Step-31">Step 3</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          This step is only for when you have a rational function. You simpily set the denominator to 0 and find the values of x that. The second part is a bit more difficult, so let us go over the best way to do it.<br><img src="Sketching/Step3Sketching.jpg"><br>Note: if a factor can be cancelled out then there is a hole in that x-value instead of a asymptote. If the denominator is removed because of this cancellation then there is no VA, but a hole will be present.

        <h4 id="Step-41">Step 4</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          The first part of this step is to identify the degree of the numerator and denominator. If the numerator's degree is less than or equal to the denominator, then a HA exists. We need to find it and collect information around it. Let us first solve for the HA<br><img src="Sketching/Step41.jpg"><br><br>Next we need to find if the graph is above or below the HA, and if the HA is crossed<br><img src="Sketching/Step42.jpg">

          This is the last step for rational functions. If the numerator is only one larger than the denominator, then you can divide the two to find a oblique function.

          This step asks us to find critical points. What is a critical point? A critical point is any point where f'(x)=0 or f'(x) is undefined and is denoted as 'c'. Then we need to use the first derivative test. The test goes as follows: If f'(x) changes from positive to negative at 'c', then f(c) is a maximum. If f'(x) changes from negative to positve, then f(c) is a minimum. Lastly, if there is not change then f(c) is called a point of inflection. Let us do an example.<br><img src="Sketching/Step6.jpg">

        <h4 id="Step-71">Step 7</h4>
        <div class="lead block">
          For this step we need to find the points of inflection, for this we need the second derivative (f''(x)). What is the second derivative represent? f''(x) determines the concavity, if f''(x) is positive then f(x) is concave up and if f''(x) is negative then f(x) is concave down. A point of inflection is anywhere that the concavity changes, and can only occues when f''(x)=0 or undefined. Let us find a few.<br><img src="Sketching/Step7.jpg">

          For this final step we need to use everything we have collected to sketch a graph. We will be sketching the function used in the skinny coloumn chart above. Here is some extra info needed for the sketch: the x-intercept is x=0, the y-intercept is y=0, the HA is y=0, as x approaches infinity f(x) lies above the HA, and as x approaches negative infinity f(x) lies below the HA.<br><img src="Sketching/Step9.jpg"><br>Drawing out all the HAs and VAs, using the infinity limits, and plotting the major points, all aid in making an accurate sketch of a curve.<br><b>This process can be repeated for any type of curve, including polynomial.</b><br><br>Sometimes certain conditions are given that need to be satisfied.
